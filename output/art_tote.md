![paint tube measurements from sue](images/art_tote/paint-tube-measurements-from-sue.jpg)

The box is 290 X 180 mm and 55 deep. Two levels would fit all but 5 of my paint tubes.

          

## Design
- 360 or 400 mm long?
- 200mm wide inside
- 55-60mm deep inside
- can't be too heavy
  - plywood for drawer bottoms
  - solid bottom for base
  - solid lid for box
  - plywood bottom for box

Not sure that the drawer is very useful, wouldn't be long enough for brushes etc.

might be better to have a long shallow(ish) removable till for brushes and small items

          
## Base
- 60mm for tubes + 30mm for till + 10mm inset for box --> 100m inside depth

## Till
- 30mm deep, 1/2 width

## Handle
not too high, but has to have room to easily remove box
## Removable box
- 60mm deep inside
